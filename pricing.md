# Pricing

*Transparent, pay-per-use pricing for distributed computing.*

<br>

## How Pricing Works

AetherGrid uses a token-based economy where computational resources are exchanged for Aether tokens. Unlike traditional cloud providers, you can both earn and spend tokens within the same ecosystem.

### Token Economics

- **Earn Tokens**: Contribute your idle computing resources to the network
- **Spend Tokens**: Use tokens to run your computational tasks
- **Trade Tokens**: Exchange tokens on supported cryptocurrency exchanges
- **Self-Sustaining**: Offset your computing costs by contributing resources during less busy hours

<br>

## Computing Costs

Pricing is based on actual resource consumption.

* When you submit a program to the grid, it's difficulty is computed on a benchmark system.
* Based on the computation difficulty and the length of time utilized, a price is calculated per system.

{: .note}
You only pay a single upfront amount. It is up to the computer clients to decide how much they will compute for the amount.
