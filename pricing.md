# Pricing

*Transparent, pay-per-use pricing for distributed computing.*

<br>

## How Pricing Works

AetherGrid uses a token-based economy where computational resources are exchanged for AetherGrid tokens. Unlike traditional cloud providers, you can both earn and spend tokens within the same ecosystem.

### Token Economics

- **Earn Tokens**: Contribute your idle computing resources to the network
- **Spend Tokens**: Use tokens to run your computational tasks
- **Trade Tokens**: Exchange tokens on supported cryptocurrency exchanges
- **Self-Sustaining**: Offset your computing costs by contributing resources

<br>

## Computing Costs

Pricing is based on actual resource consumption:

### CPU Resources

| Resource Type | Cost per Hour |
|--------------|---------------|
| Single Core | 10 tokens |
| 4 Cores | 35 tokens |
| 8 Cores | 65 tokens |
| 16+ Cores | Custom pricing |

### Memory & Storage

| Resource | Cost |
|----------|------|
| RAM (per GB/hour) | 5 tokens |
| Storage (per GB/hour) | 2 tokens |
| Bandwidth (per GB) | 1 token |

### GPU Computing

| GPU Type | Cost per Hour |
|----------|---------------|
| Standard GPU | 50 tokens |
| High-Performance GPU | 150 tokens |
| Enterprise GPU | Custom pricing |

Prices are approximate and may vary based on network demand and availability.

## Earning Tokens

### Contribution Rates

Earn tokens by sharing your computing resources:

| Resource Shared | Earnings per Hour |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Single CPU Core | 8 tokens |
| 4 CPU Cores | 28 tokens |
| 8 CPU Cores | 52 tokens |
| GPU (Standard) | 40 tokens |
| GPU (High-Performance) | 120 tokens |

### Bonus Incentives

- **Uptime Bonus**: +10% for 95%+ monthly uptime
- **Early Adopter**: +25% bonus for first 6 months
- **High-Performance Nodes**: Additional rewards for faster hardware
- **Referral Program**: Earn bonus tokens for referring new contributors
