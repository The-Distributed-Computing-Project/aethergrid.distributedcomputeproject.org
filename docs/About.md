# About

*Learn about AetherGrid and the Distributed Computing Project.*

<br>

## What is AetherGrid?

AetherGrid is a revolutionary distributed computing platform that harnesses the collective power of networked computers to solve complex computational problems. By connecting idle computing resources across the globe, we're building a more efficient and sustainable approach to high-performance computing.

## Our Mission

We believe that computational power shouldn't be centralized or wasted. Our mission is to democratize access to high-performance computing by creating a decentralized network where anyone can contribute their unused computing resources and earn rewards while helping advance scientific research, data analysis, and computational innovation.

## How It Works

The Distributed Computing Project operates on a simple principle: connect computers that have spare processing power with tasks that need computational resources. Through our distributed architecture, we:

- **Distribute workloads** across a global network of participating nodes
- **Ensure security** through cryptographic verification and blockchain technology
- **Reward contributors** with DCC (Distributed Compute Coin) for sharing their resources
- **Enable researchers** to access affordable, scalable computing power

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Network**: No single point of failure or control
- **Energy Efficient**: Utilize existing idle computing resources
- **Transparent**: Open-source code and verifiable transactions
- **Scalable**: Grow computing power organically as the network expands
